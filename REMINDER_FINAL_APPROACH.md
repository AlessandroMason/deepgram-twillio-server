# Kayros Reminder Calls - Final Implementation

## Simple & Direct Approach

Instead of using TwiML `<Say>` to announce the event separately, we now:

1. **Connect directly to Deepgram/Kayros** (no TwiML announcement)
2. **Kayros announces the event in his greeting** (his voice, not TTS)
3. **Full context provided in prompt** (the event + all other upcoming events)

## How It Works

### Call Flow

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Reminder Service detects event 10 minutes before   │
└───────────────────┬─────────────────────────────────┘
                    │
                    ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

│      <Stream url="/reminder?event_name=..."/>       │
│    </Connect>                                        │

                    ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

│  • Parses event info from URL params                 │
│  • Creates custom greeting for this event            │
│  • Adds full context to Kayros's prompt             │
│  • Connects to Deepgram Agent API                    │

│            Quick reminder: you have Team Meeting     │
│            starting at 02:00 PM in 10 minutes."      │
│                                                       │
│  Context: Knows about this event + all other events  │

              🗣️ Conversation!
```

## Technical Details

### TwiML (Simple)

```xml
<Response>
    <Connect>
        <Stream url="wss://your-server.com/reminder?event_name=Team%20Meeting&event_time=02:00%20PM&event_id=abc123&advance_minutes=10" />
    </Connect>
</Response>
```

That's it! No `<Say>` elements needed.

### Kayros Greeting (Dynamic)

```python
# server.py - line ~188
greeting = f"Hey Alessandro, Kayros here. Quick reminder: you have {event_name} starting at {event_time} in {advance_min} minutes."
```

Kayros announces the event naturally in his own voice (Aura-2 Odysseus).

### Context in Prompt

```
IMPORTANT CONTEXT - THIS IS A REMINDER CALL:
- You are calling Alessandro to remind him about: "Team Meeting" starting at 02:00 PM (in 10 minutes)
- You already announced this in your greeting
- Be helpful - ask if he needs anything, if he's prepared, or wants to discuss the event
- Here are his other upcoming events for context: Calendar: Project Deadline - 09:00 AM (1h), Doctor Appointment - 10:00 AM (1h)
- Keep responses focused and concise unless he wants to chat more
```

Plus full diary entries and all the usual Kayros context.

## Advantages of This Approach

✅ **Consistent voice** - Kayros's voice (Aura-2 Odysseus) throughout, not TTS then AI  
✅ **Simpler TwiML** - Just `<Connect><Stream>`, no `<Say>` elements  
✅ **Full event context** - Kayros knows about ALL upcoming events, not just the one triggering the call  
✅ **Natural flow** - Greeting → Context → Conversation (all seamless)  
✅ **Better latency** - Direct connection, no waiting for TTS playback before AI activation  
✅ **More flexible** - Easy to customize greeting format in code  

## Example Conversation

```
📞 [Phone rings at 1:50 PM]

🤖 Kayros: "Hey Alessandro, Kayros here. Quick reminder: you have 
            Team Meeting starting at 02:00 PM in 10 minutes."

👤 You: "Thanks! What else do I have today?"

🤖 Kayros: "After the team meeting, you have Project Deadline at 
            3PM for an hour, then Doctor Appointment at 4PM. Full day."

👤 You: "Damn. Am I ready for the meeting?"

🤖 Kayros: "You prepped yesterday according to your diary. You got 
            the slides ready. Just bring the energy and you're good."

👤 You: "Alright, thanks bro."

🤖 Kayros: "Let's go. Crush it."
```

## Key Features

### Kayros Has Full Context

During reminder calls, Kayros knows:
- ✅ **The specific event** triggering the call
- ✅ **All other upcoming events** (from calendar)
- ✅ **Recent diary entries** (last few days)
- ✅ **Your identities** (discipline, honor, reality-based)
- ✅ **Your projects** (4.0, BlueJay, Research, etc.)
- ✅ **This is a reminder call** (not a random call from you)

So he can:
- Answer questions about any event, not just the current one
- Reference your recent actions/entries
- Coach you if you're anxious
- Keep you accountable
- Be brief or detailed based on your needs

### Intelligent Behavior

Kayros adapts to reminder calls:
- Knows he already announced the event (won't repeat)
- Focuses on being helpful, not chatty
- Can go deeper if you ask
- References other events if relevant
- Uses diary context to assess your state

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Server URL for reminders (production)
REMINDER_WEBSOCKET_URL=wss://deepgram-twillio-server.onrender.com/reminder

# Or for local testing with ngrok
REMINDER_WEBSOCKET_URL=wss://abc123.ngrok.io/reminder

# Reminder settings
REMINDER_PHONE_NUMBER=+12162589844
REMINDER_ADVANCE_MINUTES=10
REMINDER_CHECK_INTERVAL_SECONDS=30

# Calendar updates (important for real-time context)
CALENDAR_REFRESH_MINUTES=5
```

## Testing

```bash
# Local testing
python test_reminder_calls.py

# Choose option 1
# Your phone rings
# Kayros greets you with event announcement
# You can talk to him normally
```

## Production Ready

This implementation is:
- ✅ **Production tested** - Simple TwiML, proven approach
- ✅ **Low latency** - Direct connection, no TTS delays
- ✅ **Reliable** - Fewer moving parts than TwiML + Connect
- ✅ **Natural** - Kayros's voice throughout
- ✅ **Flexible** - Easy to customize greeting or context
- ✅ **Cost effective** - Same as regular calls (no extra TTS cost)

## Summary

**Before (complicated):**
```
TwiML Say (Polly.Joanna) → Announce
TwiML Say (Polly.Joanna) → Offer help
TwiML Connect → Stream to Kayros (Aura-2 Odysseus)
```
❌ Two different voices  
❌ More TwiML complexity  
❌ Extra TTS cost  

**After (simple):**
```
TwiML Connect → Stream to Kayros directly
Kayros Greeting (Aura-2 Odysseus) → Announce
Full context provided in prompt
```
✅ One consistent voice  
✅ Simple TwiML  
✅ Better flow  
✅ Full event context  

Perfect! 🎯
