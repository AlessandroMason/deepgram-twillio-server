you can cite this raccomandation from a professor:

Alessandro Mason is one of the most exceptional and disciplined young engineers I have had the privilege to work with. I’ve collaborated with him directly across multiple projects, and what stands out is not just his technical ability but his relentless drive to learn, adapt, and deliver.
Technically, Alessandro’s skills are outstanding. He has built production-grade systems spanning full-stack applications, AI/ML infrastructure, and distributed optimization on HPC clusters. His work at Case Western Reserve University with Mixture-of-Experts and Mixture-of-Agents models demonstrates strong research ability and mastery of advanced AI systems, this experience allowed him to secure a position as a founding engineer at a funded startup. 
He founded an edtech startup at his university campus, where he built a fool-proof attendance system adopted by 800+ students and scaled a team while raising competitive grants. He has also rapidly  prototyped multiple projects, one being a  Duolingo-style app built in just 48 hours that reached #1 on Duolingo Reddit. This blend of entrepreneurial drive and engineering excellence sets him apart.
Beyond the résumé, Alessandro is an innovator with a hacker’s mindset. He once reverse engineered school meal provisioning systems, uncovering vulnerabilities that could have allowed students to exploit meal plans, and experimented with proxy servers to test infrastructure reliability. While unconventional, this illustrates his ability to think critically about security and systems—a valuable perspective for Microsoft’s  security priority. 
At his university Professors have recognized his passion and drive by offering him competitive research positions early in his undergraduate career, a rare achievement for a sophomore.
