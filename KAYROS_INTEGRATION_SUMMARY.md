## Files Modified

- TwiML now announces event, then connects to websocket endpoint
- Updated `test_reminder_call()` to use new connection method
- Passes event info via URL parameters to the websocket

### 2. `server.py`
**Changes:**
- Added `reminder_event` parameter to `get_complete_prompt()`
- Added reminder context to AI prompt when event info is provided
- Updated `twilio_handler()` to accept `reminder_event` parameter
- No greeting for reminder calls (already spoken in TwiML)
- Added new `/reminder` endpoint in `router()`
- Parses event info from URL query parameters
- Updated startup messages to show new endpoint

### 3. `test_reminder_calls.py`
**Changes:**
- Updated test call description to explain Kayros AI connection
- Added step-by-step explanation of what happens during test call
- Made it clear this is a real interactive call, not just a message

### 4. Documentation
**New files:**
- `docs/KAYROS_REMINDER_UPGRADE.md` - Complete guide for the Kayros integration
- `KAYROS_INTEGRATION_SUMMARY.md` - This file

## How It Works

```
1. Reminder Service detects event 10 min before start
        ‚Üì
2. Makes Twilio call with TwiML:
   - <Say> announces event
   - <Say> offers help  
   - <Connect><Stream> to websocket with event info
        ‚Üì
3. Server receives connection on /reminder endpoint
   - Parses event name, time, id from URL params
   - Adds event context to Kayros prompt
   - Uses same config as personal assistant
        ‚Üì
4. Kayros AI activates with full context
   - Knows this is a reminder call
   - Knows what event is coming up
   - Has access to diary and calendar
   - Can have full conversation
        ‚Üì
5. You can talk to Kayros normally
   - Ask questions about the event
   - Get help preparing
   - Just acknowledge and hang up
   - Whatever you need!
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables Used

```bash
# Existing (no changes needed)
DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=your_key
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_sid
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_token
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=+1234567890
GMAIL_PASSWORD=your_gmail_password

# Reminder Configuration
REMINDER_PHONE_NUMBER=+12162589844  # Default phone (your number)
REMINDER_ADVANCE_MINUTES=10  # Default timing
REMINDER_CHECK_INTERVAL_SECONDS=30  # Check frequency

# New for Kayros Integration
REMINDER_WEBSOCKET_URL=wss://deepgram-twillio-server.onrender.com/reminder
CALENDAR_REFRESH_MINUTES=5  # Keep events up-to-date
```

## Testing Locally

### Quick Test Steps

```bash
# 1. Start server
python server.py

# 2. In another terminal, expose with ngrok
ngrok http 5000

# 3. Set the ngrok URL
export REMINDER_WEBSOCKET_URL=wss://your-ngrok-id.ngrok.io/reminder

# 4. Run test
python test_reminder_calls.py

# 5. Choose option 1 to send test call
# Your phone will ring, you'll hear Kayros, then you can talk!
```

## Production Deployment

### Render Setup

In your Render dashboard, add/update these environment variables:

```bash
REMINDER_WEBSOCKET_URL=wss://deepgram-twillio-server.onrender.com/reminder
CALENDAR_REFRESH_MINUTES=5
```

Everything else stays the same! The reminder service will automatically:
1. Detect events 10 minutes before
2. Call you with Kayros announcement
3. Connect you to the AI
4. Work perfectly without any intervention

## Example Conversation

```
üìû [Your phone rings]

ü§ñ Kayros: "Hey Alessandro, this is Kayros. Quick reminder: 
            you have Team Meeting starting at 02:00 PM in 10 minutes.
            I'm here if you need anything. What's on your mind?"

üë§ You: "Thanks! What was the topic again?"

ü§ñ Kayros: "Based on your calendar, it's the weekly standup. 
            You were going to discuss the BlueJay progress."

üë§ You: "Perfect, I'm ready."

ü§ñ Kayros: "Let's go. Show them what you got."

üë§ You: [hangs up]
```

## Technical Details

### New Endpoint: `/reminder`

The server now has three websocket endpoints:

1. **`/twilio`** - Personal assistant (manual calls)
2. **`/generic`** - Public assistant (anyone can call)
3. **`/reminder`** - Reminder assistant (automated calls)

All use the same infrastructure but:
- `/reminder` includes event context in the prompt
- `/reminder` has no greeting (already spoken in TwiML)
- `/reminder` receives event info via URL parameters

### Event Context Added to Prompt

When Kayros connects for a reminder, he receives:

```
IMPORTANT: This is a REMINDER CALL. Alessandro has "Team Meeting" starting at 02:00 PM.
You already announced this at the start of the call. Now he's talking to you.
Be helpful - ask if he needs anything, if he's prepared, or if he wants to discuss the event.
Keep the conversation focused and concise unless he wants to chat more.
```

This ensures Kayros:
- ‚úÖ Knows why he called
- ‚úÖ Doesn't repeat the announcement
- ‚úÖ Stays focused and helpful
- ‚úÖ Is concise (you're probably busy)
- ‚úÖ Can go deeper if you want to talk more

## Cost Impact

### Additional Costs (vs. simple voice message)

- **Deepgram**: ~$0.02-0.06 per call (STT + TTS)
- **OpenAI**: ~$0.01-0.05 per call (GPT-4.1)
- **Total**: ~$0.03-0.11 per reminder (depends on length)

### Monthly Estimate

- 5 events/day √ó 30 days = 150 reminders
- Average $0.05 per reminder = **~$7.50/month**

**Well worth it for:**
- Never missing events
- Having Kayros help you prepare
- Full conversational AI assistance
- Peace of mind 24/7

## What Kayros Can Do Now

During reminder calls, Kayros has:

‚úÖ **Full diary access** - Knows your recent activities  
‚úÖ **Full calendar access** - Can check other events  
‚úÖ **Same personality** - Coaching, accountability, humor  
‚úÖ **Event context** - Knows why he's calling  
‚úÖ **Conversational AI** - Can handle complex questions  
‚úÖ **Coaching capability** - Can motivate or calm nerves  

Example uses:
- "What should I prepare for this meeting?"
- "Am I ready for this workout?"
- "What time does this end? Do I have time after?"
- "Can you remind me what we decided last time?"

## Next Steps

### To Deploy:

1. ‚úÖ Code is ready (all changes made)
2. ‚úÖ Test locally with ngrok
3. ‚úÖ Set environment variables in Render
4. ‚úÖ Deploy to production
