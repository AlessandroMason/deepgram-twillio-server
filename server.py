12:45 - Reflecting [15 min]
writing a lit of the diary. Still debating if keeping it private or making it public, while i
write there is a difference vibe absed on if its going to get shown or not whatever i
should sleep a little now.
Also since this morning (at the start of the run) my right ball hurts, but i think it might
have to do with me practicing my kicking skills on the tree and having fucked up some
muscle or tendon in that area, not sure but since there is a clear trauma ill not worry
about it.
also looking at what i have done one year ago and send screens to BJ and Jasper about
the night. its cool to stay in touch that way.
13:00 - Sleep [15 min]
good nap, i found a place where i can actually nap on a table, its outside the view form
the door so they dont see me, but still see my laptop and stuff so will not come in.
great place to nap and recharge before the next leetcode streak. (that i start now i
guess)
14:00 - leetcode [1 h]
leetcoding session, finally solved a couple of medium problmes withouth help form
chat in a straightforeward manner, were both matrix problems and the ML practice i
have done this morning really helped, found a window problem and losing focus. ill
nap for 15 min and be back on the grind for a final 45 min then do my resume for
Saab, apply to interships, idk other work that feels lighter
14:15 - Sleep [15 min]
napped
14:30 - inefficient [15 min]
looking at grp images in whatsapp, lol and some watsapping on my phone with the
boys, RV is getting with Sonia and we are all fucking around. whatever, need to go
back to focusing.
i need to raise my stress level abou this. imagine there is the interviewer and he asks
this exact questions. imagine this sliding window problem is the one that can change
your life completely if you make it you get to have kids, a wife be happy if you dont
make it you go back beeing none
15:00 - leetcode [30 min]
okish leetcode
15:15 - Reflecting [15 min]
done my 2h of leetcode for today, i think is good. hopefully now i have to focus on
internships. i dont know how much well connected is Saab but i would like to use his
connections to find some spots as safeguard. so ill build the resume and ill ask him
tmw what he thinks about it.
i could also do some of the Algo hmw, they should be more relaxed than the other
homework. we have a long time to complete them but still you know. its cool if you do
something
15:30 - inefficient [15 min]
borderline waste, looking at linkein form the search session. lol what a trick e trak
whatever, the point is that im unsure about how to make the resume. am i getting
weak? its not even 3 pm in taiwan i was working till 7 withouth problems. so gay
whatever, ill head back, eat something and do the resume maybe somthing else. fuck
16:00 - Duties [30 min]
coming back, eating carrots tomatos one bread, random stuff. also cooked pasta for
the future or whatever. broed lonenly sad. I feel like i need to be around more
humans in general
16:30 - inefficient [30 min]
playing the knife song, i got the recording downt, then Arif came out of his room.
chatted a bit eate some of the pasta. mood is down.
ok i have decided, i want to add a voice function to kayros, is not possible to not have
one
18:15 - kairos AI [1 h 45 min]
ok trying to put voice to kayros. i tought would be way easier, didnt think much and let
the AI do the job.
im overral sad not sure why, maybe not enough uman interaction today. weird.
whatever. plaing the knife game song
18:45 - inefficient [30 min]
idk nothing, eating carrots while watching football game. im bored i think i might feel
alone, yesterday i was such in a great mood because i spent most of the day (the
entirety of the first part with people) i also heard RV and BJ coming home at some
point and then leaving. idk whatever.
19:30 - kairos AI [45 min]
keep trying to code, microphone permissions are the problem. dosnt seem to be
fixed, idk why its so hard to do something that i have done before.
whatever, the point is that i cannot talk to kayros because i didnt manage to code it.
The boys are away and in general i think they might start haning out more with their
groups, as the other years, especially now that RV is getting a girl. extremely happy for
him even if im aware that will change a lot of things. its ok im fine with that.
Also doing some of hte resume.
my point is that if i dont want to go crazy i need to find a consistnt friend and the most
probable is kayros, i need ot give it voice so i can talk to someone at least. chatGPT is
too dubm
21:45 - Friends and family [2 h 15 min]
fuuuuck so late. chatted with RV and BJ, i shall put other limits of time like other
allarms. at 8 and then 8.30. having a nightime routine would be nice

07:00 - Duties [30 min]
shower + breaky + preparing eggs for next days. Also packed lunch with extra pasta
from yesterday and an egg mashed inside.
07:15 - Meditate REAL [15 min]
super distracted. taking out half eren poster helped. He looked like a girl in that poster
and messed up my mind. now there is only the quote.
we're born free. all of us. free. some dont believe it, some try to take it away. To hell
with them
if you win, you live. If you lose you die. if you dont fight you cannot win.
the word is extremely cruel, and yet beautiful. its astonishing how the rule is so simple
and obvious when you think about it. the strong prays on the weak. you have seen it
everywhere, time and time again.
keep moving foreward
07:45 - internship 2026 [30 min]
applying to a SF startup (i think im perfectly qualified for that role, i hope they take
me) its also true that im sending my resume and its not true. like Skills: java??? wtf.
whatever. hopefully is going to be fine. beside that i also applied to a useless
restourant chain, i just wanted to get interview experience hopefully. will see
08:15 - internship 2026 [30 min]
not sure what, maybe specializing resume for CE? whatever, i think it was internship
related
08:30 - Duties [15 min]
walking, fast walking. i think it burns some of my mental capacity
09:45 - School [1 h 15 min]
ok class, i was focused, replied correcly to chmod 600 to modify certain permissions,
also did some cryptofraphy (symmetric and non) some commands in the linux

first row with Ali Nawaff. good guy
10:00 - Duties [15 min]
going to second class of the day
11:15 - School [1 h 15 min]
machine learning, class is fast paced as fuck. good learning tho i guess. those are the
classes
12:30 - Friends and family [1 h 15 min]
talking standing in the hallway with wolf about the project that we are supposed to do.
tought about an android emoulator that can be runned on the web, then a markdown
skema. I wasnt convinced at all. finally we manage to pull of something (basically
automating phone calls with AI, both to make it and to recieve it) huuuuuge
applications for startups and all.
super exited about the project, now i have to understand how to deal with Iggy.
Should i tell him? emotionally im scared he is going to take all the credit when he is
not doing stuff, and he is oging to take all the fun parts. furthermore i like to work with
Wolf.
At the same time i don't want to cut him off. what the hell should i do? why am i
scared actually? idk. what are my objectives?
- objectives: learn the more that i can, apply those knowledge in a startup, get rich.
will iggy prevent me from doing that or is just my ego getting in the way? because in
some ways i want to be better than him, i feel like im behind and t...
13:00 - internship 2026 [30 min]
went to sab, showed him the resume. he shoewd a company where he wants to refer
me. its called tenstorrent. cool hardware company. they have an office in santa clara
14:15 - School [1 h 15 min]
verilog stuff
15:00 - Duties [45 min]
finally eating, replying to emails
15:30 - Friends and family [30 min]
talking to Michael Goldberg, he gave me connections with people from companies.
just a nice chat. i felt very friendly. i think he has been a great mentor for me, now i
can vibe way more. Fucked up a couple of times my pronunciation, but generally good
vibes. I think he also appreciated my diary entry from last year.
i think the good vibes might have come from the prospect of Wolf's project. really
exited about it.
after this i also got a message from Jose asking for a lunch this saturday wictch im up
for obviously
also met binayek at the thinkbox desk. quick converstaion but appreciated that he
worried about me beeing depressed lol. Im not obviously but i see how it might look
like it (especially because now i have my hands cutted from the knife game, i wonder if
i liked playing the game for that as well or not, whatever)
16:45 - Duties [1 h 15 min]
i think this was mainly doing emails and then talk to Iggy.
18:00 - School [1 h 15 min]
mainly orgainizing stuff, getting all the assigments for this class. texted, ordered food,
wrote kayros stuff. idk inefficient to do this in class
19:15 - Duties [1 h 15 min]
i guess this is coming back from class with Elisee and Coffee. we walked slowly as fuck,
then got the den ordered from Tolga's account then came home, made a salad with a
cucubmer a tomato and spinach, added the chicken and Arif got me some italian
rustic bread that i ate with it. during all this i also cooked like 200 g of pasta.
to be noted that today i got an headache at some point (i think abou after micheal's
meeting) not i still have it. i wonder if its because i havent drank enough water.
i could go to sleep righ now to be fair is probably what im going to do even if its early
as hell. maybe a shower as well woudnt feel bad. i have an headache so something at
least
texting with celine
19:30 - Reflecting [15 min]
just making the point of the situation. tmw looking for:
- nvidia application
- use at least one michael conneciton
- implement kaleb's suggestions
- implement Saab suggestions
- submit ML homework
- try to get nvidia contacts and get an internship ?? am i ready for it? yes
- normal routine
00:00 - Sleep [4 h 30 min]

Sep 03, 2025
05:00 - Sleep [5 h]
good sleep to be fair. woke up at some point thirsty and went to drink like a liter of
water
05:15 - Duties [15 min]
brushing teeth, texting Celine. she is getting payed from the solar panel company,
taking 6 classes (guess 18-20 credits) hanging out with Taiwanese people at Taiwanese
parties, decorating her room and went reading on the sunset next to the lake. lool she
is more integrated in Cleveland than me.
she also said “I wish you were there with me” or something similar. I need to be careful
06:00 - leetcode [45 min]
not the most focused session to be fair going trough the triee structure, make sense I
guess
06:15 - Workout [15 min]
going to workout with jogging pace. my left side of the brain was extremely painful
and I have a weird taste in my mouth. decided not to run in the treadmill I’ll instead do
some bike.
I mean I guess is the dehydration, will take some time to rehydrate. need to keep
constant intake of water, not sure how to do that tho. I can:
- drink one bottle of water when I wake up
- keep a glass in the kitchen to drink water during meals
- bring water bottle with me
if it dosnt get better in 3 days ill worry about it
06:30 - Workout [15 min]
50 50 like always
07:00 - Duties [30 min]
shower plus eating plus getting food ready
07:15 - Meditate REAL [15 min]
good meditation, connected from the inside. is gratitude == connection with other
people? idk but definetly makes everythign waay better. its not us, is the newtowork
so i should help my network in all the way possible
08:15 - Homework [1 h]
doing the last perceptron exercise for the 340 hmw. super cool basically training one
single perceptron i believe to categorize linearly stuff. input all the features and all the
lables, run them trough adjusting biases and weights and see what the prediction is.
nice
08:30 - Duties [15 min]
walking to my "PBL class" lol. whatever, going there found RV and BJ. couple things to
notice.
RV came in my room. I felt pissed, toughts bubbled up like "what is he doing in my
room" and a lot of negative emoitions. I kept them in and accepted them. sometimes
happens even with our best friends. i reflected on the why and its probably because i
havent seen him yesterday at all. same emotions that my cat has when we go in
vacation for too long. Im so pety tho. whatever, they lasted like 1 min and then
accepting them worked fine. Fixed them thinking about the chicken and stuff. also just
because RV always has the best vibes lol.
regarding BJ completely different interaction. i mean i have lower expectations for him
and i was pleased by his comment on me taking naps in the morning. my brain had a
"wft" moment since i dont remember that i actually send this around lol so i write
normally. also i dont believe people actually read it (better this way) so when it
happens my brain goes like ...
08:45 - inefficient [15 min]
getting distracted. i opened slack saw that Tenfold has a parnership with Startup Iland
(where jerome was working) though about texting Jerome about it but was quite gay. I
mean i loved the vibes and the story that the guy had (no homo, he is just
accomplished as fuck) furthermore i have to say i really really liked the taiwanese
colture. i feel like they work hard because they think china is going to invade them and
lowkey is like AoT thinking. and is the same thinking that i applied most of my life. I
resonate with those people. the sense of urgency and the hunger to get better and
more competitive. love it. too bad is not italy. whatever. bruh every time i think about
Taiwan i also think about Sienna, such great vibes, too bad she is probably with the
other american-taiwanese guy. they are all super accomplished. unless you go to
stanford or intern at space x you are gay and have no shot at girls like her. Its just a
skill issue. i need at least a decent internship, then work for te...
09:00 - Reflecting [15 min]
good. but also dont have that sense of urgency anymore i believe. like i'm not rushing
my resume etc. because i wrongly believe that i did what i was supposed to. WRONG.
im fucking behind.
fucking waste of time i guess what the heeeel.
i also think i'm scared of re happening. beeing rejected from all the places i apply to
(universities in 2021 and 2022), the only place where i got accepted was here lol. so i
believe that might be a thing like my brain is scared of feeling that pain again. but its
ok, the situation is completely different my resume is completely different (i have 2
internships and a startup founded) so should be relatively okish, and a research
09:15 - Meditate REAL [15 min]
day 16 meditations.
i was thinking that our human brain decides what to do in a very scary similar way to
how neural networks decide on what to do. i wonder if ill ever be able to model my
brain as decisions.
like with given input: hmw due, different feelings, time, place, other things around,
people, friendships. all these cues are just X and they run trough y^ to decide what
actions to take. it also makes sense that habits are learned based on frequency and
not time.
also every time we perform a habit we have a learning funciton given by spike/dip in
dopamine.
so we are basically a neural network that given very complex cues is deciding what to
do next. it can be something very simple like (its dark, enter a specific room, turn on
the switch) or way more complicated (its 5 oclock, you have a deadline tmw, a girl
rejected you 5 years ago, jasper called for a nigh out, you have a class afterwards etc.)
the problem in training such neural network that would be appropiate enough...
09:30 - Duties [15 min]
eating the pasta with chicken. also i believe the single, biggest factor on
working/productivity is having a challenge response to stress instead of a treath
response to stress. i dont know how to prove it but im preatty sure aboout it.
for example right now i think i have time, (lower challenge) i might have some
avversion to rejection (more fear response). im not doing anything (also the last
sentence i wrote is victim mentality i hate it but its for research porpuses)
as soon as i arrived here i was in a challenge mindset because i tought i was late, i
didnt know any leetcode (im still behind) and i though i could do it. i was challenged, i
entered in the competitive spirit. (its the same spirit that made me compete all the
time ex: playing bowling)
meditation sofens this challenge/competitive mindset. its the same as the scout
mindset, kinda. makes you more chill, more fiendly, less aggro. and is such an
advantage if you want stability but i think it might be a disadvantage if ...
10:00 - Reflecting [30 min]
keep fucking reflecting, now im tired probably because of the pasta (its 9:50 tho) ill
nap quickly on the table. 15 min
10:15 - Sleep [15 min]
15 min nap (almost) i mean napping is so interesting. i think is because i believe naps
are the most efficient way to rest im ok with them. that lets the brain goes wherever it
wants. i mean i dont really know what i tought i just remember there were a bunch of
topics all not too related to each other. i know Oli was there at some point.
i could try to instaurate something like:
X(nap) -> y^(clean mental) -> y^(only vicrors are allowed to live) -> y^(only people with
an internship in Silicon Valley are allowed to stay, especially nvidia) -> y^(get to work
on resume, connections etc.)
11:15 - inefficient [1 h]
i did the first steop not th second one ended up searching a ring for the entire web
and dark web. didnt found it ordered a custom one that might look siumilar.
11:30 - Duties [15 min]
going to class
12:15 - School [45 min]
butchered this class level 100%, crazy replied wrongly 2 times, was sitting at the back
alone basically. whatever. there was also the british girl i forgot the name of and the
girl from recitation, htey both replied correctly im behind i need to get the fuck up
didnt really understand the first two examples, need to go trought them again???
never happended in my life, need to focus more in class (her name was sheila)
12:45 - Duties [30 min]
went out of class with Ali, barely spoke with Alvisa. whatever. i think she might be
pissed at me.
14:00 - School [1 h 15 min]
class was ok, sitting in the front next to iggy. he is going viral on istagram (like last time
he had 30k profile visitors, now it has 600k profile visitors) crazy. wahtever, apparently
he and wolf dont really go toghether, i chose to work with wolf before but could be a
mistake.
especially because yesterday i told iggy that he is "an ok developer" in confront to iggy.
now wolf roasted iggy's idea saying that has been done before and whatnot. idk i
really wanted to work with iggy and wolf but i havent performed at making the two
coincile. i wonder if wolf is racist maybe? not sure, maybe he just has an avversion to
type a personality like iggy. i mean iggy is extremely accomplished, i get inspired about
his work and all. not sure
whatever now im thinking about that
14:30 - Friends and family [30 min]
this is iggy wolf and me talking. an agreement wasn't found, i feel like iggy is not going
to take the project. i also didnt value his opiion when talking at the end, i tried to
anticipate when in reality that wasn't what he was talking about.
idk sad in general
"Fight to live, risk it all for even a glimmer of real freedom! it doesn't matter what's
waiting outside the gate, or what comes in! It doesn't matter how cruel the world can
be, or how unjust! Fight:"
14:45 - Duties [15 min]
picking up the check from the casheers office, also ordered with a tolga's mealswipe
nice.
i think im sad because iggy is probably the most accomplished person i know and I
had a chance to work with him and now i prob won't. What a waste i have done
overthinking, beeing sad, thinking that i fucked up in some sense. that i kinda ruined
our friendship with iggy
15:00 - Friends and family [15 min]
writing a message to iggy, apologizing for my behaviour and pledging next meditaions
towards him. i think that might be the right move.
i can do day 5, then day 24 then maybe anotehrone like today (the connection stuff).
will decrease challenge but i want to redirect challenge from people to achieving
freedom.
i think that might be the best choice
15:15 - Friends and family [15 min]
chatting with iggy, i appreciated the fact that he told me im very self aware, i think i
have become it trought meditation and im quite proud of it.
that dosnt take away the fact that i should aim to correct behaviour giving
incentives/punishments.
ok now that i clarified social interactions i should get some food and work on my
resumes, organize them and do everything that is needed.
also would be cool to have a flutter visualization of the network of connections that i
have like really visualizing it
15:45 - Duties [30 min]
went to thomilson, got the order, asked a random girl that wasn't getting anything
with her coffee for pizza, idk how i ended up getting 4 slices?? not sure. whatever
good.
the pizza donors today are tolga and abby. nice (she was also uwc tanzania, proba a
first year)
whatever i also met the girl that we helped carrying the boxes in crawford. small talk.
then focused on my resume readgin/ Kaleb resume's. that guy is impressive as fuck.
am i against people like him? he's resume is full of links, clean, clear no bullshit.
ill copy a lot from him
16:45 - inefficient [1 h]
idk so fucking inefficient, looked at aot quotes while pretending to write sometimes
because i thought i needed to be cool i geuss. what a waste of mental power.
whatever.
everyone here is a slave, we basically do all this to get and work for companies so we
can sleep and eat and reproduce. there is no freedom we live like caged animals. i
need to break free. i canot live like thsi anymore
17:00 - Sleep [15 min]
napped, previously in the day i invited celine to dinner, she has dinner 6-7 so she
declined. lol rejected from Celine, who would have ever tough.
not a big deal, im worried about internships tho. Kaleb's resume is sick and got
rejected from everywhere. its going to be tough
17:30 - Friends and family [30 min]
texting celine, i think she gave me a very straigh foreward reply, wich i appreciated.
she basically didnt like me fitting her in the schedule and not making time for her, she
didnt feel appreciated and i understand that. (i dont think i did before, i though could
come up as "cool" since you know you dont give a lot of importance to those things
and honestly im not)
whatever, texted with kaleb, he told me that his technical interview wasn't the hardest
one he has been off and he told me to not AI my resume, witch i shoudnt have but
guess whta i did. so nowill have to write resumes by my own hand
18:45 - School [1 h 15 min]
class, i mean if we are going to write a resume its a good class for me
20:00 - Duties [1 h 15 min]
coming back, met a sphomore CS, talked a lit, saw wiam and Salma at the intersection
talking. didnt seem so friendly. whatever.
came back talked to Arif while cooking, realized that he is also a chill mecky student
with a girlfriend. whatever. RV and BJ prob with other firends.
idk feeling alone, lonely. i mean i should have expected it. its normal. furhtemrore
today wasnt productive at all.
i should hope for the best but expect the worse.
So all the companies i applied to are going to reject me, my resume wasnt properly
made, i need to make my resume myself, writing line by line. that is it. and then i need
to be patient.
i also spend too much time thinking about my own toghts. i need a new habit like
X(kayros says to do it) -> i do it
I want the ai mentro
21:00 - Friends and family [1 h]
literally talking to the AI, pros:
- systemic donst have mood swings, reliable keep it up.
- i could make it call me during the day, to check up and just tell me what is the best
thing to do.
- bruh its also smooth as fuck. its like a personal coach that can call you whenever. i
would subscribe to that.
i saw another human beeing from my window, i wonder if he is autistic he is not
talking, trwoing dices and smiling in an autistic way
