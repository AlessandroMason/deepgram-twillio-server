writing a lit of the diary. Still debating if keeping it private or making it public, while i
write there is a difference vibe absed on if its going to get shown or not whatever i
should sleep a little now.
Also since this morning (at the start of the run) my right ball hurts, but i think it might
have to do with me practicing my kicking skills on the tree and having fucked up some
muscle or tendon in that area, not sure but since there is a clear trauma ill not worry
about it.
also looking at what i have done one year ago and send screens to BJ and Jasper about
the night. its cool to stay in touch that way.
13:00 - Sleep [15 min]
good nap, i found a place where i can actually nap on a table, its outside the view form
the door so they dont see me, but still see my laptop and stuff so will not come in.
great place to nap and recharge before the next leetcode streak. (that i start now i
guess)
14:00 - leetcode [1 h]
leetcoding session, finally solved a couple of medium problmes withouth help form
chat in a straightforeward manner, were both matrix problems and the ML practice i
have done this morning really helped, found a window problem and losing focus. ill
nap for 15 min and be back on the grind for a final 45 min then do my resume for
Saab, apply to interships, idk other work that feels lighter"""
